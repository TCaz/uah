## General Notes
##### *Remember: it's not magic*

The most important thing to remember is that this *isn't magic*. 
I feel that the class is doing a poor job of enabling a constructive 
view and approach of programming this microcontroller. There are a few 
constructs which I wish to make pertinent across this git project to 
remedy the hand-waving and lack of proper documentation we're facing, 
the most important of which is that the 'peripheral registers' which 
allow you to configure a port and interact with the outside world 
are viewed as *just that* by the controller. It's a register, and I 
hope to make this as apparent as possible in the following documentation 
and sample code.

#### Personal Project Ideas
 
* Create project which works with the ~90ms brain delay
* Control a servo with a potentiometer
* Create Neopixel lights for ACE's server room
* Take over the world
* Build an autonomous car

### General C Programming Points

* Make sure to encapsulate bitmask comparisons with () esp when using `&&` and `||`
	* This is done **incorrectly** on the sample programs, and you should fix it.
	* See page 48 in the Davies textbook. Seriously, read it.
* `#include <msp430.h>`
	* This is the correct way to include header files. Specify the model elsewhere.
	* Also done improperly in sample programs.
* `volatile` variables are ones which are changed outside the scope of the program.
	* These vars are kept in registers, and defeat a lot of optimizations.
	* They do not have to be used for interrupt service routines (usually?)
* `&&` and `||` are boolean operators, meaning they operate on a value as a whole.
	* `&`(AND), `|`(OR), `^`(XOR), `~`(NOT) are bitwise operators, 
		* meaning they operate on each bit of a value.
* BIT0 - BIT7 are bit masks, with zeros everywhere except the specified location.
	* i.e. BIT3 = 00001000.

#### Bit Examples

	B = 1010
	A = 1001
	
	A & B = 1000
	A | B = 1011
	A ^ B = ????
	A ~ B = ????

### Bit Masks

	A Byte:
	[0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] = 0x00
	 7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
	MSB                         LSB

### Common Bit Masks

* BIT0 through BIT7
	* Ostensibly, from the Davies text, these bitmasks exist up to BITF, 
		but I haven't played with that yet.
	* The digit corresponds to the '1' in a byte.
	* For instance, `BIT5 = [0] [0] [1] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] = 0x20`
	* Read page 48 in the Davies textbook.

* Timer_A
	* TACLK: clock input to the timer
	* TA0 and TA1: either inputs or outputs
	* TACTL: Timer_A Control 

### Registers (consistent across msp devices)

* R0 / Program Counter / PC
	* Holds address of the next instruction.
* R1 / Stack Pointer / SP
	* Holds address of top of stack.
* R2 / Status Register / SR
	* Contains status flags.
* R3 / Constant Generator
	* Provides the six most frequently used values from RAM?
* R4 - R15
	* General Purpose Registers

### Interrupts

Interrupts are maskable, meaning they only work when the General Interrupt Enable (GIE) bit is set in the Status Register (SR). This means that the enable bit in the local module, as well as the GIE must be set for interrupts to be handled.


	
### Clocks (somewhat consistent across msp devices)

* Basic Timer 1
* Watchdog Timer
* Master Clock [MCLK]
* Subsystem Master Clock [SMCLK]
* Auxiliary Clock [ACLK]

Defaults:

- ACLK: 32,768Hz
- MCLK, SMCLK: 1.048576 Mhz

### IAR Bullshit (aka setup configs)

* Create a project, open the options window
* GENERAL
	* TARGET: Set device to MSP430FG4618
	* OUTPUT: Output file set to EXECUTABLE
	* LIBRARY CONFIGURATION: LIBRARY set to NONE (ASM) or NORMAL DLIB (C)
* C COMPILER
	* OPTIMIZATIONS: LEVEL set to NONE
	* OUTPUT: GENERATE DEBUG INFORMATION
	* LIST: OUTPUT LIST FILE and ASSEMBLER MNEMONICS checked
* ASSEMBLER
	* LIST: OUTPUT LIST FILE checked
* LINKER
	* OUTPUT: DEBUG INFORMATION FOR CSPY and RUNTIME CONTROL MODULES and I/O EMULATION checked
	* LIST: GENERATE LINKER LISTING and SEGMENT MAP and MODULE MAP
* DEBUGGER
	* SETUP: DRIVER set to SIMULATION
	* FET debugging: set speed to max and turn on validation.

### MSP Naming Convention

- MSP: Mixed Signal Processor
- The letter after msp430 indicates type of memory.
	- F: Flash memory
	- C: ROM
- A second letter shows the type of intended measurement:
	- E: Electricity
	- W: Water
	- G: Signals (which require a gain stage by an op amp?)
- The next digit indicates family, and the final two or three detail the specific device
	- MSP430x1xx: General Purpose
	- MSP430F2xx: Newer, general purpose line (2005). Runs at 16Mhz, uses less power. Comes in DIP packages!
	- MSP430x3xx: Original family, obsolete.
	- MSP430x4xx: Can drive LCDs, has a lot of pins usually.
	- MSP430X: Original architecture. A part of the F2xx and F4xx lines.

#### Lab devices

- MSP430FG4618: Flash memory, signal processing, can drive LCDs and has many pins.
- MSP430G2231: Unknown memory? Signal processing.
