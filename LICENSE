Because academic honesty is such a disgusting bastard, 
and so poorly documented on my campus's shiny new 
wordpress template, you are hereby forbade from even reading 
files with the intention of copying or stealing information 
to change your grade.

Files on this project which were /not/ created by 
Christopher Bero fall under their prospective author's 
licenses, which /should/ have been included in the file. 
If it isn't, look up the author 
(you know, without opening the file) and ask for a license.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
