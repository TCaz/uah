Because academic honesty is such a disgusting bastard, and so poorly documented on my campus's 
shiny new wordpress template, you are hereby forbade from even reading my homework, 
which include all files in this cms. Seriously, why are you even here?

Unless of course it's one of the example programs by an instructor (we don't have much in the way of professors here) 
or otherwise /not/ my work, in which case ask the cooresponding author for their license information 
without opening the file first.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
