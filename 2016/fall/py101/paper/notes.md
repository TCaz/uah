### Definitions

Second Language: L2

Lexical Association Stage: L2 words are associated with their first language L1 translation equivalents. Later stages bring nuanced meaning and fluency.

"From a psycholinguistic point of view, vocabulary acquisition can be
conceptualized as establishing lexical (or form-level) and semantic representa-
tions and incorporating them into the mental lexicon" - pg2

This study focuses on L1 to L2 mappings (Lexical Association) and is thus unconcerned with linking conceptual representations. The study focuses further on retrieval based study methods, where the L1 or L2 word is presented, and the subject must attempt to recall the linked counterpart.

Receptive retrieval - translating from L2 to L1

Productive retrieval - translating from L1 to L2

Four types of retrieval formats:
* Receptive recall - Asked to produce the meaning of target words.
* Productive recall - Asked to produce the target word form corresponding to the meaning provided.
* Receptive recognition - Asked to choose the correct meaning of target words from options.
* Productive recognition - Asked to choose the target word form corresponding to the meaning provided.

Forward association: When the direction of study matches the direction of testing (studying L1 to L2 translations and then testing on L1 to L2 translations).

Backward association: When the direction of study does not match the direction of testing (study L1 -> L2, test L2 -> L1).

Forward asymmetry effect: Phenomenon where the forward association is easier than the backward association.

Receptive retrieval is generally easier.
