Chapters 6 and 7

* Learning - A relatively permanent change in behavior and understanding due to experience.
* Associative learning - When an organism makes connection between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment.
* Pavlov's Discovery - Classical conditioning.
* Classical Conditioning
    * Natural stimulus causes a reflex.
    * Natrual stimulus paired with neutral stimulus.
    * Neutral stimulus soon generates the same reaction as the original.
* General process in classical conditioning
    * Acquisition
    * Extinction
    * Spontaneous recovery
* John B. Watson's experiments with Little Albert show that classical conditioning may play a role in creating phobias.

Behaviorism

* John Watson, B. F. Skinner
* Instrumental and Operant Contitioning
    * Behavior is controlled by its consequences
* Edward L. Thorndike
    * Studied animals' intelligence and ability to solve problems
* B. F. Skinner
    * Expanded and formalized many of Thorndike's ideas
    * Operant Conditioning
    * Analyzed how behavior is changed by its consequences
* Operant conditioning
    * Learn responses by operating on the environment
    * Operant - A behavior that has some effect on the world
    * Reinforcer - Positive or negative responses to the operant
    * Shaping - Successive approximations of the target behavior
    * Reinorcement - Primary (food, water) and Secondary (money, praise)
* Reinforcement Schedules
    * Continuous - Reinforce every correct response. Fast learning, and fast extinction
    * Partial/Intermittent
        * Fixed Ratio
        * Fixed Interval
        * Variable Ratio
        * Variable Interval

Cognitive Processes in Learning

* Learned Helplessness - Giving up effort to control environment
* Latent Learning
    * Edward Tolman
    * Cognitive maps
* Observational Learning / Social Learning
    * Live - Demonstrates a behaior in person
    * Verbal - Explains or describes the behavior
    * Symbolic - Gandhi, Superman
    * Bandura's Bobo doll study - Children attack dolls after seeing video of violence
* Vicarious Experience
    * Children more likely to model adults who were praised for their actions
    * Less likely to model adults who were punished

* Charles Spearman - Intelligence consists of a single factor, g.
* Raymond Cattell
    * Crystallized Intelligence - Acquired knowledge and ability to retrieve it
    * Fluid Intelligence - Ability to see complex relationships and solev problems
* Robert Sternberg - Triarchic Theory off Intelligence
    * Practical Intelligence - street smarts
    * Analytical Intelligence - ability to analyze, evaluate, judge, compare, and contrast
    * Creative Intelligence - Inventing or imagining a solution to a problem
* Howard Gardner - Multiple intelligence theory
    * Linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, bodily, kinesthetic, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and natrualistic intelligence
    * A person excels in some and falters in others
    * Emotional intelligence - ability to understand emotions, show empathy
