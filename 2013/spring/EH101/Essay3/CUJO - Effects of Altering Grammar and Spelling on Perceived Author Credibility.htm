       		<p class="abstract">This study aimed to examine the relationship between passage quality and perceived author credibility. Passage quality was defined as the number of mechanical errors in a text, whereas perceived author credibility was defined as the degree to which participants believed that the author was a reliable and truthful source. Two surveys and a passage in three different forms (a good passage containing no errors, a fair passage with a few errors, and a poor passage with many errors) were completed by 69 college students in a between-subjects design. Survey questions measuring perceived author credibility were examined in order to detect a difference in participants’ responses among the three passage quality conditions. A significant difference was detected between participants perceived author credibility. The results of this study suggest that a text of better quality will elicit greater degrees of perceived author credibility from the readers of the text.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
purpose of this study was to investigate a potential relationship between
passage quality with respect to grammar and spelling, and perceived author
credibility. Heyman (1992) described how credibility can be divided into two
dimensions, or factors: a trust factor and a qualification factor. That is, an
individual’s perceived credibility is based upon the degree to which the
perceiver finds the individual to be trustworthy and competent in the given
topic area. While much research has been gathered on factors affecting
credibility, the majority of this research has focused on face-to-face or
verbal communication between the participant and the individual whose
credibility is being assessed (King, Minami, &amp; Samovar, 1985). In addition,
subject variables contributing to perceived credibility such as gender and
ethnicity have been studied exhaustively (Gomez &amp; Pearson, 1990). There is
a scarce amount of literature regarding potential impacts of grammar and spelling
on perceived credibility available, therefore this is one particular variable
that is worth exploring. Brown (2004) points out that grammatical and spelling
errors make up the number one reason why articles are rejected upon submission
to publishers. He goes on to say that an individual who is inattentive to detail
could be perceived as being inattentive to the quality of the research being
done for the journal. While this logic is generally accepted by the public,
there is no mechanism that has been formed to explain why this occurs. This
study is imperative to understanding if there is a relationship between passage
quality and perceived author credibility.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
coherence of a text-based passage has been shown to affect the interest of the
reader in that passage (Schraw, 2001). Coherence is defined in this case as the
degree to which the reader can understand the text. Alterations in grammar and spelling
can cause a passage to be less coherent; therefore, the interest of the reader
in the passage is decreased. This idea should be applicable to perceived author
credibility, since one of the factors affecting credibility is interest
(Pratkanis &amp; Gliner, 2004-2005). Due to the fact that subject material,
passage length, and use of jargon can also affect the interest of a reader in a
passage, these variables must be controlled (or at least held constant) in
order to observe only the affect of changes in grammar and spelling. </p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citera,
Beauregard, &amp; Mitsuya (2005) conducted an interesting experiment that
relates to text-based credibility. Participants were placed into two
treatments: a face-to-face (FTF) negotiation condition and an e-negotiation
condition. In the FTF negotiation condition, participants were paired and each
played the role of a buyer and a seller (these roles were then interchanged so
that everyone could be a buyer and a seller). Various costs of an automobile
were negotiated before a survey was completed that examined the participants’
degree of trust and perceived credibility in the dealings with their partner.
The same conditions were followed for the e-negotiation condition. However, the
dealings between participants took place in an internet chat environment. The
results of this experiment indicate that the FTF negotiation approach fosters
greater trust between the buyer and seller, and it also improves the buyer’s
perceived credibility of the seller. This is explained by the Psychological
Distance Theory, which states that closer physical interaction with an
individual fosters relationship building, whereas a lack of physical
interaction causes a person to be more wary of that individual (Citera,
Beauregard, &amp; Mitsuya, 2005). These results indicate that the perceived
credibility of an author is likely to be less when reading a text by that
author than it would be if the reader were to speak about the topic
face-to-face with the author. </p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
fact that the reader has no physical basis on which to judge the author of a
text (as in a face-to-face situation) leaves a limited number of factors on
which the reader can base the credibility of an author. Fragale (2004) has
identified familiarity with a text to be correlated with an increased
acceptance that the text comes from a credible source. Fragale tested this by
revealing to participants six urban legends regarding food products. In one
condition, the participants were given these legends twice, and in another
condition, the six urban legends were repeated five times each. Participants
were then asked if it was likely for each of the legends to include facts found
in Consumer Reports (a credible source). There were significantly more
participants who believed that the legends could be found in Consumer Reports
for the five-times repetition condition than there were for the two-times
repetition condition, indicating that familiarity with a topic can cause the reader
to attribute that topic to a credible source. This provides a warning that the
subject matter of a passage can influence the perceived credibility of an
author, based upon how experienced the reader is with the information in the
passage.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Work
by Pratkanis &amp; Gliner (2004-2005) has produced results that concur with
these findings. By examining the effects of message and message source on
message effectiveness, Pratkanis &amp; Gliner were able to show that the impact
of a topic on the reader can be predicted by the subject matter of the topic
and who is presenting the topic. This was done by having two conditions for
each independent variable. For the message, a protection message was used
(nuclear disarmament) and a technical message was used (the possible existence
of a tenth planet in our solar system). For the message source, either a second
grade schoolgirl was used or an older, professional-looking male doctor was
used. Participants were found to be impacted more by the nuclear disarmament
message (protection) when it came from the schoolgirl, and they were impacted
more by the tenth planet message (technical) when it came from the doctor. This
interaction shows that perceived credibility can also be influenced by the
subject matter. Expertise in a particular area causes an individual to be more
credible in their area. Therefore, it is important to make a passage that could
come from a variety of sources exhibiting a gradient of reliability based upon
their degree of expertise in the given subject area.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
research on credibility identifies factors such as passage interest, coherence,
technicality, expertise, etc. as being significant influences upon perceived
author credibility. However, none of these issues specifically addresses the
mechanics of language use. What if a highly credible source (say, an
astrophysicist) writes a paper on a topic in which they have expertise, but it
is a poorly written paper (mechanically speaking)? If the same paper had better
mechanics, would it be perceived as being written by a more credible source?
This study will attempt to answer these questions by dividing participants
(consisting of University students) into three groups. One group of
participants will receive a passage that has no grammatical or spelling errors,
another group will have a passage with minor grammatical and spelling errors,
and the final group will read a passage with severe grammatical and spelling
errors. A survey completed before the passage is read will introduce controls,
such as interest in the passage topic and judging the credibility of varying
levels of academic status. The survey taken after the passage is read will
measure the participants perceived credibility of the author of the passage.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
primary goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between the use
of proper grammar and spelling and the perceived credibility of an author. The
literature presented indicates that coherent, interesting, and repeated
passages will result in a greater degree of perceived author credibility.
However, research also shows that information presented in a text format will
be perceived as being less credible than when the same information is received
in a face-to-face situation. Due to the fact that this study involves a
text-based passage and not a physical interaction between the participant and
the author of the passage, grammar and spelling should play a significant role
in the coherence, and therefore perceived credibility, of the author. Proper
grammar and spelling were expected to improve perceptions of an author’s
credibility, whereas improper grammar and spelling were expected to worsen
perceptions of an author’s credibility.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="jump31"></a>Method</h3>

<h4><i style="">Participants</i></h4>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recruited
participants consisted of students on campus at <st1:place _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on"><st1:placename _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on">Clemson</st1:placename> <st1:placetype _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
who were over the age of 18. Thirty male and 39 female participants were
recruited, resulting in a total of 69 participants. The average age of the
students was 20.26, with a range of 18 to 30 and a standard deviation of 1.86.
There was one 30-year old participant who was not dropped, because age was not
expected to influence perceived author credibility. Two of the 69 participants
were dropped. The first participant that was dropped disagreed with question 5
on the pre-passage survey (gave a response of “2”), so their response to question
5 on the post-passage survey was defined as being invalid. The second
participant was dropped for the same reason, and also because they responded in
a significantly different manner to questions 3 and 4 of the pre-passage survey
as they did to questions 1 and 2 of the post-passage survey. This discrepancy
was significant enough to suggest that the passage affected the participants’
responses, so their remaining responses could not be considered valid. There
were three levels of the independent variable, and 23 participants were
assigned to each level. Participants were collected via convenience sampling,
since the investigator recruited fellow students by word of mouth. The
participants were then assigned to one of the three levels of the independent
variable (“good passage,” “fair passage,” or “poor passage”) through the use of
a random number generator. Participants were volunteers, and therefore received
no compensation for their inclusion in the study. There were no specialized
prerequisite skills that the participants were screened for. Before completing
the surveys, the participants needed to read and understand an informational
letter. The participants were asked if they had any questions regarding the content
within the informational letter before they participated in the study.</p>

<h4><i style="">Materials</i></h4>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Informational letter</i>. Approached
participants were required to read the informational letter. This letter
identified the purpose of the study, the participants eligible for recruitment,
the tasks that the participants would complete, the amount of time that the
surveys would take, the voluntary nature of the study, and the contact
information of the investigators.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Pre-passage survey</i>. The first survey
that the participants completed will be referred to as the “pre-passage survey,”
and it can be found in Appendix A. The first two questions (regarding age and
gender) on the pre-passage survey were collected to describe the sample. The
next three questions were based on a six point Likert scale, with “1” being a
strong disagreement and “6” being a strong agreement with the statement being
made. Questions 3 and 4 asked the participant to indicate how strongly they
felt about the importance of proper grammar and spelling, respectively. These
two questions were designed as control questions to see if the participant was
affected by the passage (the post-passage survey contained the same two questions
to see if the passage changed the participant’s feelings regarding proper grammar
and spelling). Question 5 asked the participant if they felt that a college
professor is a more credible source of information regarding their specialty
than a graduate student. This was a control question to ensure that the
participant believed that a college professor is a more credible source than a graduate
school student. This was necessary to give validity to question 5 in the
post-passage survey, which asked participants to identify who they thought was
most likely the author of the passage.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Post-passage survey</i>. The second survey that
participants completed will be called the “post-passage survey,” and it can be
found in Appendix C. After reading the given passage, participants answered
five questions. The first four questions were based on a six point Likert
scale, with “1” being a strong disagreement and “6” being a strong agreement
with the statement being made. Questions 1 and 2 regarding proper grammar and spelling
respectively were intended to be control questions, and they are identical to
questions 3 and 4 in the pre-passage survey. Their purpose was to examine if
reading the passage had any effect on participants’ feelings towards proper
grammar and spelling. Question 3 asked the participant if they believed that
the passage consisted of accurate information. This question was used to
quantitatively assess the participants’ degree of perceived author credibility.
Question 4 asked the participant if they believe that the author of the passage
is a credible source. This was another measure taken into account when rating
the participants’ perceived author credibility. Question 5 also measured credibility,
but it is not on a Likert scale. It asked the participant to identify who was
most likely the author of the passage: an elementary school student (the least
credible choice), a middle school student, a high school student, an
undergraduate student, a graduate student, or a college professor (the most
credible choice). In order to ensure that these options were presented from the
least credible to the most credible source, precautions were taken in question
5 of the pre-passage survey to measure the magnitude of credibility for two of
the responses present in question 5 of the post-passage survey. This made
question 5 a more reliable measure of perceived author credibility. No
questions on the pre-passage or post-passage survey needed to be
reverse-scored.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Passage</i>. The passage came in three
different forms, representative of the three levels of the independent
variable: the “good passage,” “fair passage,” and “poor passage,” which can be
found in Appendix B. The good passage contained no grammatical or spelling errors.
The fair passage contained relatively easy to make grammatical and spelling
errors, whereas the poor passage contained a large number of grammatical and
spelling errors. The passage was selected from a technical writing website by
Dennis G. Jerz (2000). D. G. Jerz provided permission to alter the passage into
the “fair” and “poor” forms (personal communication, February 17, 2006). In the
“fair passage,” there were a total of ten mistakes, six of which were spelling
errors and four of which were grammatical errors. In the “poor passage,” there
were a total of 31 mistakes, 20 of which were spelling errors and 11 of which
were grammatical errors. All mistakes made in the fair and poor passages were underlined
in Appendix B. Note that the passages given to participants did not have
headings (such as “good passage,” “fair passage,” and “poor passage”), and they
also did not have any underlined mistakes.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Debriefing form</i>. After collection of the
post-passage survey, the debriefing form was given to participants. This form
provided the participants with the purpose of the study, the hypothesis of the
investigator, and the contact information for the principal investigator and
the co-investigator.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Other materials</i>. Pens and clipboards were
provided for the participants’ convenience. Also, the investigator provided
participants with a folder to put the pre-passage survey, passage, and
post-passage survey into. The folder was provided for the participants to place
these items into in order to protect the participants’ anonymity.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="">Study environment</i>. Participants were
recruited in the Cooper Library at <st1:place _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on"><st1:placename _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on">Clemson</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place> from multiple
levels of the library building. The collection process took place over the
course of two nights, and recruitment occurred on these two consecutive nights
between the hours of 6:00 PM and 12:00 AM. </p>

<h4><i style="">Apparatus</i></h4>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
only specialized equipment used in this study was an online application called
the Random Number Generator (Daniels, 2001-2003). This program was written in
Javascript, and selects integers at random based upon an algorithm that is
organized by time. The program was employed to randomly assign participants to
each level of the independent variable. Block randomization was also used by
assigning the three levels of the independent variable once to each of three
participants.</p>

<h4><i style="">Procedures</i></h4>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
a volunteer was interested in being involved in the study, the individual was
given the informational letter to read. When the participant had finished
reading the informational letter, the investigator asked the participant if
they had any questions regarding the letter. If the participant agreed to take
part in the study, then the participant kept the letter. The investigator then gave
the participant the pre-passage survey, a clipboard, and a pen. The pre-passage
survey had previously been numbered on the top-right corner of the page. The
passage and post-passage survey had this same number on their top-right corners
in order to identify which surveys and passages went together (for example, one
participant received a pre-passage survey, passage, and post-passage survey
that all had a “1” on their top-right corners. The next participant had a “2”
on the top-right corners of all three of their forms). Once the participant had
completed the pre-passage survey, they placed it into the folder provided by
the investigator in order to maintain their anonymity. After placing the
pre-passage survey into the folder, the investigator gave the participant the
passage. Participants received one of three types of the same passage: a “good
passage,” a “fair passage,” or a “poor passage.” A random number generator was
used in order to assign participants to one of these three passages. Upon
completion of reading the passage, the investigator gave the participant the
post-passage survey. The participant was then notified by the investigator that
they were allowed to refer to the passage while completing the post-passage survey.
Once the participant had completed the post-passage survey, the participant
placed the passage and post-passage survey into the same folder that they had placed
the pre-passage survey into. The investigator then collected the folder from
the participant.</p>

<h4><i style="">Design</i></h4>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
study was set up in order to compare the means of participants’ responses to
three questions (Questions 3, 4, and 5 of the post-passage survey) across three
levels of the independent variable (passage quality) and see if a difference
among each level was present. In order to do this, three separate one-way
ANOVAs (one for each of the three questions) were run, and Bonferroni’s Post
Hoc Test was also conducted for each question. Since each participant only
received one of the three levels of the independent variable, and each
participant was randomly assigned a level, this was a between-subjects design. </p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
independent variable that was examined was passage quality. Passage quality in
this case referred specifically to the proper use of grammar and spelling in a
written work. There were three treatments of the independent variable: the
“good passage,” “fair passage,” and “poor passage.” The good passage contained
no grammatical or spelling errors, the fair passage contained a total of ten
errors (six spelling errors and four grammatical errors), and the poor passage
contained a total of 31 errors (20 spelling errors and 11 grammatical errors).
Passage quality was an assessment of the grammatical and spelling mechanics
used in a written work, and it was split into three treatments to see if it
related to perceived author credibility.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
dependent variable examined was perceived author credibility. The perceived
author credibility in the case of this study was a reader’s confidence that the
information that they read comes from a reliable, truthful source. In this
study, perceived author credibility was placed on a discrete scale, ranging in
magnitude from “1” (low perceived author credibility) to “6” (high perceived
author credibility). The post-passage survey examined this in questions 3, 4,
and 5. Questions 3 and 4 were already in their quantitative forms (with a
response of “1” indicating low perceived author credibility and a response of
“6” indicating high perceived author credibility), but question 5 was converted
to a quantitative form. A response of “Elementary School Student” indicated a
value of “1” (low perceived author credibility), whereas a response of “College
Professor” for question 5 indicated a value of “6” (high perceived author credibility).
Note that these values were only assigned to the responses on question 5 of the
post-passage survey if participants agreed with question 5 of the pre-passage
survey (a response of “3,” “4,” “5,” or “6” was given). Perceived author
credibility was therefore quantified, so as to give a basis for defining low
and high confidence that the participant has in the reliability of the
information within the passage.</p>

<h4><i style="">Data
Quantification</i></h4>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
questions on the pre-passage survey and post-passage survey were separated into
“question types.” Question 3 on the pre-passage survey (which asks how strongly
participants feel about proper grammar use) was designated as the “Grammar”
question type. Question 4 on the pre-passage survey (which asks how strongly
participants feel about proper spelling use) was likewise defined as the
“Spelling” question type. Question 5 on the pre-passage survey (which asks how
strongly participants feel that a professor is a more credible source in their
specialty area than a graduate student is) was condensed to the “Professor”
question type. On the post-passage survey, a similar nominalization process was
conducted in order to display results in a more succinct manner. Question 1
(which was the same as Question 3 on the pre-passage survey) was also labeled
“Grammar,” and Question 2 (which was the same as Question 4 on the pre-passage
survey) was also labeled “Spelling.” Question 3 on the post-passage survey
(which asks participants to identify how accurate the information in the passage
was) was labeled as “Accuracy.” Question 4 on the post-passage survey (which
asks how credible the author is) was labeled as “Credibility,” and Question 5
(which asks who is most likely the author of the passage) was labeled “Author.”
Questions 3, 4, and 5 (Accuracy, Credibility, and Author, respectively) were
used as measures of perceived author credibility.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
the pre-passage survey, one-way ANOVAs were conducted for the Grammar,
Spelling, and Professor question types with response to the three passage
quality conditions. This checked for pre-existing differences between groups.
For the post-passage survey, one-way ANOVAs were also conducted for Grammar,
Spelling, Accuracy, Credibility, and Author in regards to passage quality.
Grammar and Spelling from the post-passage survey were examined to ensure that
no differences existed in responses presented among the groups of participants
in each condition. Accuracy, Credibility, and Author were examined to see if
perceived author credibility changed with passage quality. Finally, a 3
(passage quality) x 2 (survey type) design was examined in a repeated measures ANOVA.
The two questions examined within each survey type were Grammar and Spelling.
This was conducted in order to determine if the passage had any effect upon
participants’ responses to the Grammar and Spelling question types in the
pre-passage and post-passage surveys.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="jump75"></a>Results</h3>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><i style="">Analysis
of Pre-passage Survey</i></p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Figure
1 shows the responses of participants on proper grammar use, proper spelling
use, and whether or not they see a professor as being a more credible source
than a graduate student for the pre-passage survey. Responses of participants
to proper grammar use (“grammar”) was compared between passage quality using a
one-way ANOVA to determine whether or not there were any pre-existing
differences between groups. The ANOVA revealed that there were no significant
differences in participants’ responses to the “grammar” question. In a similar
manner, the responses of participants on proper spelling use (“spelling”) was
also compared between groups using a one-way ANOVA. Again, no significant
differences among participants’ responses to the “spelling” question were found.
Finally, participants reported how strongly they felt that a college professor
is a more credible source in their area of specialty than a graduate student is
(“professor”), and their responses were also compared between the three groups
by using a one-way ANOVA. There was no significant difference between the
responses of participants to the “professor” question among passage qualities.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><i style="">Analysis
of Post-passage Survey</i></p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
a similar manner to the pre-passage survey analysis, means and standard error
of the means for the participants’ responses on the use of proper grammar and
spelling in the post-passage survey are displayed in Figure 2. Passage quality
was examined by using a one-way ANOVA. Participants’ responses regarding
grammar were also examined against passage quality for the post-passage survey.
This was to examine if any significant differences existed between groups after
the passage was read. No significant difference was discovered between groups
for grammar. Participants’ responses regarding spelling were then examined
against passage quality for the post-passage survey. No significant difference
was discovered between groups for spelling.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Figure
3 shows the responses of participants to each question measuring perceived
author credibility (“accuracy,” “credibility,” and “author”) for each passage
condition on the post-passage survey. For the question measuring accuracy, a
main effect was revealed, <i style="">F</i>(2, 66) =
8.80, <i style="">p</i> &lt; 0.001. Bonferroni’s Post
Hoc Test revealed a difference between the good passage and the poor passage,
but no significant differences between means for the good passage and the fair
passage or between the fair passage and the poor passage were found. There was
also a significant main effect found on the question measuring credibility, <i style="">F</i>(2, 66) = 12.80, <i style="">p</i> &lt; 0.001. A difference was revealed between the good passage
and the fair passage on the question measuring credibility. Furthermore, a
significant difference was also detected on the credibility question between
means for the good passage and the poor passage. No significant difference was
found between the fair passage and the poor passage. The question regarding the
author of the passage revealed a significant main effect, <i style="">F</i>(2, 66) = 21.53, <i style="">p</i> &lt;
0.001. A significant difference in responses between the good passage and the
fair passage was detected. Another significant difference was found between the
responses to the good passage and the poor passage. There was no significant
difference detected between the fair passage and the poor passage for the
question regarding the author of the passage.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Figure
4 summarizes the results of a repeated measures ANOVA that was examined to
determine if differences existed between groups for the questions regarding
grammar and spelling on the pre-passage survey and the post-passage survey.
There were no significant main effects or interactions found between or within
groups in regards to the questions on grammar for the pre-passage survey or the
post passage survey. There were also no significant differences found between
or within groups in regards to the questions on spelling for the pre-passage
survey and the post-passage survey.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a name="jump91"></a>Discussion</h3>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
order to examine whether or not a relationship existed between perceived author
credibility and passage quality, 69 students at <st1:place _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on"><st1:placename _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on">Clemson</st1:placename> <st1:placetype _moz-userdefined="" w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
were given two brief surveys and a passage to read. The passage that students
read came in three forms, which was representative of the three levels of the
independent variable: a “good passage” (with no grammatical or spell errors), a
“fair passage” (with some grammatical and spelling errors), and a “poor
passage” (with many grammatical and spelling errors). Other than grammatical
and spelling errors, the three passages were identical. Twenty-three students
were assigned to each condition, but two participants were dropped (both from
the “fair passage” condition). Three of the survey questions that participants
answered after reading the passage were used to measure their degree of
perceived author credibility, which was defined as being the degree to which
the participants believed that the author of the passage was trustworthy and
competent in the given subject matter. The three questions on the post-passage
survey used to measure their degree of perceived author credibility asked
participants if they thought that the information in the article was accurate
(Question 4), if they thought that the author of the passage was a credible
source (Question 5), and who they thought that the author of the passage was
(Question 6). Participants responded that the author of the “good passage” was
a more credible source than the author of the “poor passage,” suggesting a
relationship between perceived author credibility and passage quality.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
questions that measured perceived author credibility (Questions 4, 5, and 6 on
the post-passage survey) were referred to in the results as “Accuracy,”
“Credibility,” and “Author,” respectively. Figure 3 shows the relationship
exhibited between perceived passage credibility and passage quality with
respect to these three credibility questions. Participants perceived the author
of the “good passage” to be a more credible source than the author of the
“fair” and “poor” passages. The perceived author credibility of the “fair
passage,” however, was not found to be significantly different from the
perceived author credibility of the “poor passage.” These results suggest that
the coherence of a text-based passage (which was manipulated by passage
quality) has an effect on an individual’s level of perceived author
credibility. </p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
findings of this research concur with the work done by Ambler and Hollier
(2004), which showed how “waste” (excessive product descriptions and
euphemisms) caused participants to have a greater degree of credibility in the
item being advertised. Ambler and Hollier’s work demonstrates that information
is judged as being credible when it has a high quality (in this case, quality
was described by the amount of “waste” in the presentation). Participants who
were shown a presentation for a product with less quality generally did not
find the product to be credible. While this research focuses on the credibility
of an object, it must be emphasized that presentation does matter in any sort
of text or graphical format. The combination of this research with findings on
the potential relationship between perceived author credibility and passage
quality imply that graphical or text representations can be perceived
differently based upon the quality of the presented information.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Schraw’s
(2001) study on reader interest as a function of coherence in a text-based
passage is also convergent with the results of this research. Schraw found that
less coherent passages decreased the interest level of participants. Pratkanis
&amp; Gliner (2004-2005) identified interest as being a factor that influences
reader’s perceptions of an author’s credibility. Therefore, the presented
research extends the implications of coherence as being a key factor
determining the perceived credibility of an author. This finding will prove to
be very useful when<span style="">&nbsp; </span>information is
presented to audiences without a face-to-face interaction between the presenter
and the audience (Citera et al., 2004-2005). Citera et al. found that
face-to-face interactions between people cause greater perceived credibility
between the two people than when the two people interact over the internet. In
times when physical interaction between people is not possible, the presented
research suggests that the quality of the information being presented is
detrimental to the audience’s perceived author credibility.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
describe the level of perceived credibility of an author, coherence was a
factor that was heavily depended upon. This factor was shown to be a valid
measure of credibility on the Content-Based Criteria Analysis (CBCA)
(Zaparniuk, Yuille, &amp; Taylor, 1995). Zaparniuk et al. examined truthfulness
by using the CBCA as a criterion for judging the responses of adult witnesses
when on trial. Coherence, that is, the repeated and accurate presentation of
events, was the first scale that the CBCA uses to measure the credibility of a
witness’ story. A disjointed, discontinuous story (such as the poor grammar and
spelling inherent in the “poor passage”) was viewed as having little
credibility. Zaparniuk et al. therefore supports the assumption of using coherence
as a valid measure for perceived author credibility.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
the use of passage quality as a representation of coherence was justified, the
results of the investigation between perceived author credibility and passage
quality could be challenged. First, there could have been more questions used
that measure a participant’s perceived author credibility. Since only three
survey questions measured this, there may be an aspect of credibility that was
not covered in one of those three questions. For example, the reader could have
been asked how truthful they thought that the author of the passage was.
Furthermore, the interpretation of each question to the reader must be
addressed. Question 3 on the post-passage survey asks the reader to identify
how accurate they thought that the passage was. Accuracy, however, can be
defined in many different ways (for example, how close the passage was to being
accepted and known information, whether or not the author thought the
information he was giving was true, etc.). Question 5 on the post-passage
survey asks participants to identify who they thought that the author of the
passage was. However, after collecting the surveys, the researcher would
occasionally hear the remark that the participants merely assumed that the
researcher was the author of the passage. Further measures must be taken to
collect validity information on the questions contained in the survey of this
study. Additionally, convenience sampling was employed to gather participants
for this study. This research employed the use of students who were only found
in the library during the nighttime. A confound as large as this greatly
decreases the generalizability of the obtained results to the student
population at large. The generalizability of this study was also limited by the
subject matter of the passage. Given that the topic of the passage was
technical writing, the participants may have assumed that the writer of the
article would naturally write with few (if any) spelling or grammatical errors.
Had the passage been about a different topic (for example, a passage about
environmental sustainability), the participants may have expected there to be a
greater number of grammatical and spelling errors. The expectation that the
subject matter elicited in the participants may have served as a threat to the
validity of this study.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
these limitations of the study, internal validity was protected (especially in
respect to a selection threat) by using a random number generator to randomly
assign participants to each passage quality condition (“good passage,” “fair
passage,” and “poor passage”). Also, a script was used to ensure that each
participant was recruited in the same manner and given survey items at the
correct times and in the correct order. Question 3 on the pre-passage survey
and Question 1 on the post-passage survey were identical, and asked the
participant to indicate how strongly they felt about the proper use of grammar.
Likewise, Question 4 on the pre-passage survey and Question 2 on the post-passage
survey were identical, and asked how strongly the participant felt about the
proper use of spelling. These questions were used as controls to ensure that
the coherence of the participant’s responses were maintained. They also ensured
that the passage did not influence participant’s feelings about grammar and
spelling. Two outliers were identified by the discrepancy between their
responses to these four items, and they were dropped accordingly to maintain
the integrity of the data analysis.</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
results of this research suggest that a blind or double-blind experiment should
be conducted in the future. Since the researcher interacted with the
participants, an effect on their responses to survey items may have been
produced. It is also imperative that more valid measures of perceived author
credibility are introduced into future research in order to justify a causal
relationship between perceived author credibility and passage quality.
Naturally, the purpose of this study should be extrapolated to other age groups
and in other localities in order to test for certain region effects. A
potentially interesting longitudinal study could be conducted that examines the
perceived author credibility over time for a single author when participants
are given multiple works over time by that same author (which would be revealed
for them). Perhaps a “familiarity” effect could be identified, analogous to the
Psychological Distance Theory described by Citera et al. (2005). Moreover, it
would be interesting to see if this proposed idea could be modified to
manipulate passage quality as well (for example, participants read the same
identified author over time, but over time, the quality of the author’s writing
is intentionally decreased or increased). An examination of perceived author
credibility in response to manipulated passage quality certainly opens up many
venues for further research.</p>
